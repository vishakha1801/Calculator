# Calculator
This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum designed to brush up on front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) skills. All of the design part is handled by HTML and CSS while calculations are handled by plain JavaScript. Besides basic calculations, other features include negative sign (+/-) toggle and keyboard support. No advanced data structures like stacks, queues etc. were used.
